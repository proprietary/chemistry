# Chemistry Tools

Work In Progress

Ideally this will be a complete chemistry toolkit

## Roadmap

Ultimate goal is to be for physical/synthetic chemists what MATLAB is for engineers or MS Word is to journalists: an exceptional tool for everyday work.

+ quantum computations
+ electronic structure calcs: ab initio, Hartree-Fock/Schrodinger
+ basic ChemDraw abilities
  + GUI drawing
  + IUPAC naming
  + MO visualizations
  + reaction mechanisms as a video
+ solvent effects predictor
+ machine learning, big data parsing on journal articles
+ organic synthesis planner (!!)
